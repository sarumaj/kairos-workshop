# Kairos Workshop - Custom OCI Image Build and Release

This repository contains a partial solution for building and releasing custom Kairos OCI images, created as part of participating in the ["From Zero to Immutable Kubernetes: Your First Cluster, Step by Step" workshop](https://cfp.cfgmgmtcamp.org/ghent2026/talk/review/YHZ3AZFRJTKFD7XUUQGTSX7EL9HTU8XW) at CfgMgmtCamp 2026 Ghent (Feb. 4th 2026, 09:00–13:00, B.3.0.13).

**Note:** This is not the official workshop material. For the complete workshop guide and materials, please refer to the [official workshop repository](https://github.com/jimmykarily/cfgmgmtcamp-kairos-workshop).

## Overview

This repository demonstrates how to build and release custom Kairos OCI (Open Container Initiative) images using CI/CD pipelines. It focuses on automating the creation of immutable OS images tailored for Kubernetes deployments.

### What This Repository Covers

- Building custom Kairos OCI images
- Integrating Kairos image builds into CI/CD pipelines
- Publishing and releasing custom immutable OS images

### What is Kairos?

[Kairos](https://kairos.io) is an open-source Linux toolkit designed to make immutability practical and flexible for Kubernetes deployments. It provides a cloud-native, distro-agnostic, immutable Linux meta-distribution with features like A/B system partitions, persistent data separation, and cloud-config-driven provisioning.
