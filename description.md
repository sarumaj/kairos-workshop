## Outline

1. **What are immutable OS and how to think about operations with this paradigm**

    Explore the philosophy and architecture of immutable systems versus traditional configuration management tools. Learn how immutability enables atomic upgrades, reduced drift, simplified recovery, and stronger security postures.  **Resources**

2. **Introduction to Kairos and its major concepts**

    Get familiar with Kairos as a cloud-native, distro-agnostic, immutable Linux meta-distribution. Understand key concepts like A/B system partitions, persistent data separation, recovery mode, and cloud-config-driven provisioning.

    - [Reference](https://kairos.io/docs/reference/)

3. **Deploying a single-node cluster**

    Deploy Kairos on a VM or bare-metal machine and initialize a Kubernetes control plane using K3s and cloud-init. Validate node readiness and explore initial workloads.

    - [Manual Single-Node Cluster](https://kairos.io/docs/examples/single-node/)

4. **Build your own immutable OS**

    Use the **Kairos Factory** (from the Web or CLI) to create a custom immutable OS image tailored to your needs. Learn how to configure the base system, embed Kubernetes, and prepare for consistent provisioning.

    **Resources**

5. **Integrating OS builds into your CI/CD pipelines**

    Automate OS image building and publishing using GitHub Actions or similar CI systems.

6. **Upgrading your cluster manually**

   Perform manual upgrades using A/B partitions and Kairos commands. Practice rolling back and verifying upgraded systems.

   **Resources**

   - [Manual Upgrade](https://kairos.io/docs/upgrade/manual/)

7. **Deploying a multi-node cluster**

    Scale to a multi-node setup by bootstrapping additional Kairos worker nodes. Learn how to use cloud-config to preconfigure joining behavior.

    **Resources**

    - [Manual Multi-Node Cluster](https://kairos.io/docs/examples/multi-node/)

8. **Upgrading your cluster through Kubernetes**

    Set up the **Kairos Operator** to manage in-cluster, declarative upgrades. Apply upgrade plans to roll out updates across multiple nodes in a safe, automated way.
